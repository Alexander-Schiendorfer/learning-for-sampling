\begin{abstract}
Organizational structures such as hierarchies provide an effective means to
deal with the increasing complexity found in large-scale energy systems that 
results from uncertainties in nature as well as computational efforts in scheduling. 
In hierarchical systems, abstraction-based methods provide a way to calculate a simpler behavior model 
to be used in optimization\note{, i.e., scheduling,} in lieu of a combination of a set of behavior models.
In particular, functional dependencies over the combinatorial domain 
are approximated by repeatedly sampling input-output pairs
and substituting the actual function by piecewise linear functions. However, if
the selected input-output pairs are weakly informative, the resulting abstracted
optimization problem introduces severe errors in quality as well as bad runtime performance. \note{In other words, we want to approximate the functional dependencies as good as possible with a preferably low number of input-output pairs.}
This problem is reminiscent of the task of selecting the next most informative input for supervised learning
algorithms in case labeled input is rare.
We therefore propose to apply methods from active learning based on decision trees for regression
to search for informative
input candidates to sample and present preliminary results that motivate further research.

\section{Hierarchical Distributed Energy Management}
Future energy systems move from systems of relatively few centrally organized units
providing most of the power demanded by consumers to many highly distributed units calling
for manageable control mechanisms~\cite{Ramchurn2012}.
To deal with the resulting complexity in scheduling and controlling power plants in the face of 
uncertainties introduced by nature and technical deficiencies, hierarchical organizations based on virtual power plants
that form autonomously can be employed~\cite{Anders-TAAS-2015,niesse2014conjoint}.
In our vision of future energy management systems~\cite{Anders-TAAS-2015}, inner nodes of the hierarchy are called  \emph{autonomous} virtual power plants (AVPP) and act as intermediaries on behalf of their subordinate
agents \todot{each prosumer and AVPP is modeled as an agent}. Prosumers \todot{define ``prosumer''} are thus structured into systems of systems represented by AVPPs, which can themselves be part of other AVPPs, as 
shown in \fref{fig:hierarchical-decomposition}. To achieve a reduction of complexity in the optimization 
problem to be solved by the overall system when creating schedules for dispatchable power plants, techniques are borrowed from model abstraction~\cite{Frantz_Taxonomy}. 
In particular, functional dependencies over a combinatorial input domain stemming from the
aggregate of underlying agents are approximated by repeatedly sampling input-output pairs
and substituting the actual functions by piecewise linear functions~\cite{Schiendorfer2014}. 

In general, the problem to be solved constitutes a hierarchical resource allocation problem~\cite{VanZandt1995},
where the resource to be allocated to a set of agents maps to their scheduled contributions in order
to meet a predicted demand over a scheduling window $\Horizon$ consisting of finitely many time steps with a fixed resolution of typically 15 minutes.
 Agents have to act proactively, i.e., create schedules, since they
are subject to inertia and cannot be assumed to react fast enough in case of rapidly increasing (or decreasing) demand.
We derive the minimal set of constraints from the physical requirements that 
power plants impose (see \cite{SchiendorferSyn2014} for a discussion of the literature):
i) a minimal and maximal power boundary, ii) discontinuity given the ability to be switched off, and 
iii) functions limiting the possible change in production over a certain period of time.
The latter function
might not only depend on the type of an agent but also on its current contribution. 
From these physical constraints, we abstract minimal and maximal contributions
and switching on and off to a sorted list of \emph{feasible intervals} $\ListProduction{t}\AnAgent$.
A power plant $a$ that is capable of being switched off or running between some boundaries
$P_{\mathrm{min}}$ and $P_{\mathrm{max}}$ would then, for instance, be represented by 
$\ListProduction{t}\AnAgent = \langle [0,0], [P_{\mathrm{min}}, P_{\mathrm{max}}] \rangle$.
To allow planning for inertia in $\AnAgent$, we introduce functions $\ChangeSpeedMin\AnAgent$ and
$\ChangeSpeedMax\AnAgent$ that return the minimum and maximum contribution in a following time step
given the current contribution. In the simplest case---we consider a constant maximal change $\Delta P$---these 
functions are defined as:
%
		\begin{align*}
		\label{eq:changeInContribution}
		&\ChangeSpeedMin\AnAgent(x) \overset{\underset{\mathrm{def}}{}}{=} \operatorname{max}\left\{P_{\mathrm{min}}, x - \Delta P\right\}\\
		&\ChangeSpeedMax\AnAgent(x) \overset{\underset{\mathrm{def}}{}}{=} \operatorname{min}\left\{P_{\mathrm{max}}, x + \Delta P\right\}
		\end{align*}
%
But of course, these functions can model richer systems than that, e.g., consider a hot or cold start-up~\cite{SchiendorferSyn2014}, or
depend on the current contribution as well as rates of change that map combinatorially to the underlying agents~\cite{Schiendorfer2014}. In addition to that,
cost functions $\CostFunctionSynt{\AnAgent}$ return the minimal costs incurred for a certain
contribution.

We present the scheduling problem for some inner node---called intermediary $\AnAvpp$---since the problem is solved top-down, as shown in 
\fref{fig:hierarchical-decomposition}.
Each intermediary in turn redistributes its assigned fraction of the overall demand $\AssResidualLoad{t}{\AnAvpp}$ to 
its subordinate agents $\Subsystem$ until all leaf agents, i.e., physical power plants, are assigned schedules. Note
that the root node $\TlAvpp$ is assigned the actual total demand of the environment, i.e., $\AssResidualLoad{t}{\TlAvpp} = \DemandSym[t]$.

		\CostsObjective = \sum_{t \in \Horizon} \CostsObjective[t] = \sum_{a \in \Subsystem} \CostFunction\AnAgent{\AgentPower{t}{\AnAgent}} \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
%
We propose to solve this problem using two approaches based on self-organizing hierarchies
for problem decomposition:
\begin{itemize}
\item A so-called ``regio-central'' approach: agents transfer models to their local supervisor who, at meso-level,
centrally optimizes the allocation~\cite{Schiendorfer2014, SchiendorferSyn2014}
\item An auction-based decentralized approach~\cite{Anders-TAAS-2015} where agents need not submit their model
but only bid on a given demand based on their (possibly private) individual capabilities.
\end{itemize}

Obtaining a good abstraction of an intermediary's behavior as a compact
representation of the underlying subordinate agents' combined behavior is desirable for both algorithms.
In the regional-central case, one wants to simplify the resulting optimization problems, in particular
by reducing the decision variables and constraints to be considered. In the auction-based algorithm, 
an intermediary could, in principle, have all agents bid simultaneously to a single auctioneer, i.e., 
use a super-flat hierarchy. Clearly, this auctioneer imposes a bottleneck with
a rising number of agents. %as it has to decide which bids to accept and which to reject.
When installing a hierarchical organization for scalability, an intermediary
ought to be aware of the physical boundaries of its subordinate agents \emph{before} submitting bids 
in order to avoid inconsistencies that need to be (monetarily) punished by the organization~\cite{Anders-TAAS-2015}.
As a simple illustration, consider that the fact that an intermediary better not bid for a contribution
greater than 200 if it is comprised of two underlying physical agents with a maximal contribution of
100 each. Even if the mere summation of maximal boundaries constitutes no computational effort, 
the possible trajectories resulting from limited rates of change and disconnectability make 
the problem harder. In fact, an intermediary needs to solve an optimization problem quite similar 
to \eref{eq:csop-scheduling-hierarchy} in order to calculate bids for a given demand.
Similarly to the ``regio-central'' approach, abstraction has further to be applied to obtain a simplified model of the intermediary that its
own superior may use to compute bids.

\section{Obtaining Abstracted Models}
As we have now established the need for effective abstraction
techniques, we briefly revisit our existing approach to 
discuss improvements using active learning.

\subsection{Interval Calculations and Sampling Abstraction}
A rather straightforward and first essential abstraction in this problem is 
obtained by considering the possible contributions of an intermediary
by combining their lists of feasible intervals. Assume agent $a_1$ can contribute
in $[x_1, y_1]$ and agent 2 in $[x_2, y_2]$. Clearly, their combined contribution
must be in $[x_1, y_1] \oplus [x_2, y_2] = [x_1 + x_2, y_1 + y_2]$. The operator $\oplus$
naturally extends to lists of intervals by combining the intervals in a Cartesian fashion
and merging the overlapping intervals. That way, one will find that the combined production
of two agents $a_1$, $a_2$ with $\ListSym^{a_1} = \langle [0,0], [1,4] \rangle$ and
$\ListSym^{a_2} = \langle [0,0], [7,10] \rangle$ will be either of $\langle [0,0], 
[1,4], [7, 14] \rangle$.

But now consider questions such as ``What is the minimal cost for an aggregate to contribute
$x$?'' or ``What is the maximally possible next contribution given the momentary state is $y$''? Both 
involve solving an optimization problem since there can naturally be many configurations
of subordinate agents leading to a contribution of $x$ with different costs. To address these issues,
we acquire an abstract representation of functional relationships by \emph{sampling}, i.e., solving 
several optimization problems and collecting input and output values (e.g., contribution-cost pairs). 
Underlying constraints $C$ and decision variables $(X, D)$ 
of the sampling problems are kept identical of the optimization problem in \eref{eq:csop-scheduling-hierarchy}.
Consequently, we can give the algorithm leading to the sampling points:
%
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Sampling Abstraction for cost function $\kappa_\AnAvpp$}\label{alg:SamplingAbstraction}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\Require $(X, D, C)$ are the constraints for an intermediary $\AnAvpp$
\Ensure $\gamma$ are contribution-cost pairs 
\State $I \gets s$ sampling points $\in \ListSym^\AnAvpp$ \Comment{domain of $\kappa_\AnAvpp$}
\Procedure{sampling-abstraction}{$\AnAvpp, I$}
\ForAll{$\{i \in I\}$}
\State $C' \gets C \cup \{(\AgentPower{0}{\AnAvpp} = i)\}$
\State $o \gets $ solve $\langle X, D, C'\rangle$ : $\text{minimize } \CostsObjective[0]$
\State $\gamma \gets \gamma \cup \{(i,o)\}$
\EndFor
\State \textbf{return} $\kappa_\AnAvpp \gets \mathsf{pwLinear}(\gamma)$ 
\EndProcedure
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Issues with Sampling Abstraction}
However, if the selected input-output pairs are selected in a weakly informative way, the resulting abstracted
optimization problem introduces severe errors in quality as well as bad runtime performance. The former problem
is understandable due to unfortunate interpolations, the latter problem is less obvious but stems from the way MIP-solvers
resolve piecewise linear functions which might result in many integral decision variables that slow down the optimization.
In addition, each sampling point comes at the expense of solving a modified optimization problem. Thus, it is desirable
to avoid asking for uninformative points such as those ranging between $200$ and $400$ in \fref{fig:sampling}.

We illustrate the issue with an example of an AVPP $\AnAvpp$ consisting of three agents $a$, $b$, and $c$:
%
\begin{description}
\item[a:] $\ListSym^a = \langle [0,0], [50, 100] \rangle$, $\kappa^a = 13$
\item[b:] $\ListSym^b = \langle [0,0], [15, 35] \rangle$, $\kappa^b = 70$
\item[c:] $\ListSym^c = \langle [0,0], [200, 400] \rangle$, $\kappa^c = 5$
\end{description}
where $\kappa^i$ is the price per production unit such that the agents' cost functions are defined by: $\CostFunction{i}{x} = \kappa^i \cdot x$. We
derive the feasible contribution ranges for $\AnAvpp$ and get $\ListSym^v = \langle [0, 0], [15, 35], [50, 135], [200, 535] \rangle$. 
Sampling points are selected from this contribution range equidistantly and generally it holds that the more sampling points, the higher the accuracy, 
as \fref{fig:sampling} shows. 

\section{Improving Sampling Point Selection by Active Learning}
\todo[inline]{Just some very preliminary pointers to literature}
Active learning using Gaussian process has been applied to several problems~\cite{Krause2007,Krause2008,Park2011}. 

\section{Evaluation}
We investigate the effects of selecting a particular set of 
sampling points for one group that could have emerged as part
of a self-organization process.
