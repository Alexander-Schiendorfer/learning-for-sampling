\begin{abstract}
Organizational structures such as hierarchies provide an effective means to
deal with the increasing complexity found in large-scale energy systems that 
results from uncertainties in nature as well as computational efforts in scheduling. 
Abstraction-based methods provide a way to calculate a simpler behavior model 
to be used in optimization in lieu of a combination of a set of behavior models.
In particular, functional dependencies over the combinatorial domain 
are approximated by repeatedly sampling input-output pairs
and substituting the actual function by piecewise linear functions. However, if
the selected input-output pairs are weakly informative, the resulting abstracted
optimization problem introduces severe errors in quality as well as bad runtime performance.
This problem is reminiscent of the task of selecting the next most informative input for supervised learning
algorithms in case labeled input is rare.
We therefore propose to apply methods from active learning based on decision trees for regression
to search for informative
input candidates to sample and present preliminary results that motivate further research.

\section{Hierarchical Distributed Energy Management}
Future energy systems move from systems of relatively few centrally organized units
providing most of the power demanded by consumers to many highly distributed units calling
for manageable control mechanisms~\cite{Ramchurn2012}.
To deal with the resulting complexity in scheduling and controlling power plants in the face of 
uncertainties introduced by nature and technical deficiencies, hierarchical organizations 
that form autonomously can be employed~\cite{Anders-TAAS-2015}.
Figure~\ref{fig:avpp-hierarchical-system-structure} illustrates these so-called autonomous virtual power plants (AVPP)
that are related to the concept of dynamic virtual power plants~\cite{niesse2014conjoint}. To achieve a reduction of complexity in the optimization 
problem to be solved by the overall system, techniques are borrowed from model abstraction~\cite{Frantz_Taxonomy}. 
In particular, functional dependencies over a combinatorial input domain stemming from the
aggregate of underlying agents are approximated by repeatedly sampling input-output pairs
and substituting the actual function by piecewise linear functions~\cite{Schiendorfer2014}. 

In general, the problem to be solved constitutes a hierarchical resource allocation problem~\cite{VanZandt1995},
where the resource to be allocated to a set of agents maps to their scheduled contributions in order
to meet a predicted demand over a scheduling window consisting of finitely many time steps with a fixed resolution
of 15 minutes.
 Agents have to act proactively, i.e., create schedules since they
are subject to inertia and cannot be assumed to react fast enough in case of rapidly increasing (or decreasing) demand.
We derive the minimal set of constraints from the physical requirements that 
power plants impose (see \cite{SchiendorferSyn2014} for a discussion of the literature):
\begin{itemize}
\item a minimal and maximal power boundary
\item discontinuity given the ability to be switched off
\item functions limiting the possible change in production over a certain period of time.
\end{itemize}
The latter function
might depend on the type of an agent as well as the current contribution. 
From these physical constraints, we abstract minimal and maximal contributions
and switching on and off to a sorted list of \emph{feasible intervals} $\ListProduction{t}\AnAgent$.
A power plant $a$ that is capable of being switched off or run between some boundaries
$P_{\mathrm{min}}$ and $P_{\mathrm{max}}$ would then for instance be represented by 
$\ListProduction{t}\AnAgent = \langle [0,0], [P_{\mathrm{min}}, P_{\mathrm{max}}] \rangle$.
To allow planning for inertia in $\AnAgent$, we introduce functions $\ChangeSpeedMin\AnAgent$ and
$\ChangeSpeedMax\AnAgent$ that return the minimum and maximum contribution in a following time step
given the current contribution. In the simplest case---we consider a constant maximal change $\Delta P$---these 
functions are defined as:
%
		\begin{align*}
		\label{eq:changeInContribution}
		&\ChangeSpeedMin\AnAgent(x) = \operatorname{max}\left\{P_{\mathrm{min}}, x - \Delta P\right\}\\
		&\ChangeSpeedMax\AnAgent(x) = \operatorname{min}\left\{P_{\mathrm{max}}, x + \Delta P\right\}
		\end{align*}
%
But of course, these functions can model richer systems than that, e.g., consider a hot or cold start-up~\cite{SchiendorferSyn2014},
have a dependency on the current contribution, or rates of change that map combinatorially to the underlying agents~\cite{Schiendorfer2014}. In addition to that,
cost functions $\CostFunctionSynt{\AnAgent}$ return the minimal costs incurred for a certain
contribution.

\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:csop-scheduling-hierarchy} \textstyle
		& \underset{\AgentPower{t}{\AnAgent}}{\operatorname{minimize}} & 
		\alpha_{\ViolationObjective} \cdot \ViolationObjective + \alpha_{\CostsObjective} \cdot \CostsObjective \\
		& \operatorname{subject\ to} & \forall a \in \Subsystem, \forall t \in \Horizon : \exists [x , y] \in \ListProduction{t}\AnAgent : x \leq \AgentPower{t}{\AnAgent} \leq y\text{,} \nonumber \\
		& & \ChangeSpeedMin\AnAgent \left(\AgentPower{t-1}\AnAgent\right) \leq \AgentPower{t}{\AnAgent} \leq \ChangeSpeedMax\AnAgent\left(\AgentPower{t-1}\AnAgent\right) \nonumber\\
		& & \textstyle \text{with } \ViolationObjective = \sum_{t \in \Horizon} \left|\Production_\Subsystem[t] - \AssResidualLoad{t}{\AnAvpp} \right| \text{, } \nonumber \\
		& & \textstyle \text{and } 
		\CostsObjective = \sum_{a \in \Subsystem,\ t \in \Horizon} \CostFunction\AnAgent{\AgentPower{t}{\AnAgent}} \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}

We propose to solve it using an approach based on self-organization:
\begin{itemize}
\item A so-called ``regio-central'' approach: agents transfer models to their local supervisor who, at meso-level,
centrally optimizes the allocation~\cite{Schiendorfer2014, SchiendorferSyn2014}
\item An auction-based decentralized approach~\cite{Anders-TAAS-2015}
\end{itemize}

\section{Issues with Model Abstraction}
However, if
the selected input-output pairs are selected in a weakly informative way, the resulting abstracted
optimization problem introduces severe errors in quality as well as bad runtime performance.

\section{Improving Sampling Point Selection}

\section{Evaluation}
We investigate the effects of selecting a particular set of 
sampling points for one group that could have emerged as part
of a self-organization process.
